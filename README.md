<h1>Mental Health and Social Media</h1>
Mental health globally is declining, we are having a surge of mental health issues due to the increase in technologies and post-COVID19. Utah people are also a part of the epidemic, and we wanted to investigate the link between social media and mental health.

<h1>What we did:</h1>

- For our website, we got it deployed to the internet and AWS has a custom DNS Record, it also uses HTTPS.
- We got the data to 3rd normal form and have the steps of us achieving this.
- We stored our data in a PostgreSQL, the app updates the database with new entries, and you're able to search the entries!
- We used various CSS Styles and bootstrap to make our page more user friendly and nice to look at. 
- In our website you're able to see the dashboard, you're able to login, you're able to register an account, and the location is set to Provo by default.
- Can only access with a special username and password which are, username: admin, password: password.
- You can see the data from the survey on the report page as well.
